[[overview-http-media-types]]
= Media types

The *Accept* and *Content-Type* HTTP headers can be used to describe the content being sent or requested within an HTTP request.
The client may set *Accept* to *application/json* if it is requesting a response in JSON. Conversely, when sending data, setting
the *Content-Type* to *application/xml* tells the client that the data being sent in the request is XML.
